# Wind-Turbines-Level-A
The wind turbine failure dataset (SCADA â€“ Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) has measurements recorded every 10 seconds, from wind turbine sensors. The variable names are unknown, but they represent sensor measurements that correspond to various physical process properties.

## The main task of this project is Fault detection using control charts and sensor diagnostics.
We will use the following steps to solve the given task:

1. Understand data and modeling goal
2. Data pretreatment
3. Modelling plan
4. Feedback for the model
5. Initial model results
6. Feedback and model improvement
